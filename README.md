## What's a SpaceFrame?

Independently in 1900 and 1950, Alexander Graham Bell and Buckminster Fuller developed the [Space Frame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_frame), one of the strongest construction frameworks ever devised. It employs either a triagonal or octahedronal cross-truss shape to distribute loads. Space frames are used in architecture and performance vehicles, and are lightweight, inexpensive and easy to implement.
